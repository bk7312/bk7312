### Hi there 👋

I'm a self-taught front-end developer currently learning React and UI design. When I'm not coding, I usually like to read and drink tea, and sometimes dabble in the art of ukulele-ing.

Current tech stack experience:

[![Frontend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,react,tailwind)](https://skillicons.dev)
[![Backend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=firebase,appwrite)](https://skillicons.dev)
[![Deployment](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vercel,netlify,github)](https://skillicons.dev)

<hr/>

Here's a rough roadmap of where I am and where I'm heading.

- May 2023 - Completed the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path course (Teaches HTML/CSS/JS, React, React Router, Firebase, Netlify)! [View Certificate](https://scrimba.com/certificate/uY52m7Tk/gfrontend)
- Jun 2023 - Completed my first hackathon (Used React, React Router, Appwrite, Tailwind CSS, Vercel)! [View Entry](https://bk7312.hashnode.dev/townsquare-an-open-source-forum-for-a-small-town)

Coming up next:
- Learn next.js and typescript (I'll learn it next after getting better at React-ing and handling unexpected JS type errors, pun intended. Protip: Assume everything is a `string` and check accordingly. Yes, the `value` of `<input type="number"/>` is a `string`, and I just saved you an hour of debugging.)
- Learn UI design principles, Modern CSS, and styled components (Jul 2023)
- Learn the AWS or Azure platform (Maybe AWS in Jul 2023 by participating in this [hackathon](https://hashnode.com/hackathons/aws-amplify-2023))
- Learn unit testing, git version control and staging (Q3 2023)
- Learn server-side rendering, edge and serverless functions (Q3 2023)
- Learn Svelte and Astro (Q4 2023)
- Learn node.js, GraphQL, and how to use a CMS (Q4 2023)
- Build a progressive web app (2024)
- Learn Electron or React Native or Tauri to build mobile/desktop apps (2024)
