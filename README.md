### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught front-end developer currently learning React and UI design. When I'm not coding, I usually like to read and drink tea, and sometimes dabble in the art of ukulele-ing.

Current tech stack experience:

[![Frontend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,react,tailwind)](https://skillicons.dev)
[![Backend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=firebase,appwrite)](https://skillicons.dev)
[![Deployment](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vite,vercel,netlify,github)](https://skillicons.dev)

Here's a rough roadmap of where I am and where I'm heading.

- May 2023 - Completed the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path course (Teaches HTML/CSS/JS, React, React Router, Firebase, Netlify)! [View Certificate](https://scrimba.com/certificate/uY52m7Tk/gfrontend)
- Jun 2023 - Completed my first hackathon (Used React, React Router, Appwrite, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Vercel)! [View Entry](https://bk7312.hashnode.dev/townsquare-an-open-source-forum-for-a-small-town)

Coming up next:
- Learn Next.js and TypeScript (I'll learn T<sub>hi</sub>S Next after getting better at React-ing and handling unexpected JS type errors, pun intended.)
- Learn the AWS or Azure platform (Maybe AWS in Jul 2023 by participating in this [AWS hackathon](https://hashnode.com/hackathons/aws-amplify-2023)?)
- Learn UI design principles, Modern CSS, and styled components (Q3 2023)
