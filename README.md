### Hi there 👋

I'm a self-taught web developer currently learning web development. When I'm not coding, I usually like to read and drink tea, and sometimes dabble in the art of ukulele-ing.

Current tech stack experience:

[![Frontend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,react,tailwind)](https://skillicons.dev)
[![Backend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=firebase,appwrite)](https://skillicons.dev)
[![Deployment](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vite,vercel,netlify,github)](https://skillicons.dev)
