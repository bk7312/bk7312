### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer currently learning mobile development with react native. When I'm not coding, I usually like to read books and drink tea, do some calisthenics, or dabble in the art of ukulele-ing.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my collection of [bookmarklet](https://bk7312.github.io/bookmarklets/). I adore bookmarklets, they're just so simple and versatile!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mobile development with react native. The first thing a lot of non-dev people ask when I tell them I'm a developer is: "So you make android/ios apps?". I took it as a sign.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source JS/TS projects, let me know if you need a helping hand and I'll see how I help.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with connecting developers to people with problems that need solving. There's a lot of developers out there, and there's also a lot of people with problems that needs solving. How do we bridge the gap?
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you find interesting or curious about, I have lots of opinions that I may or may not be entitled to have.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can schedule a call on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/bk7312/call) and let's chat!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can do [mirror writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_writing) with my left hand!
