### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a hobbyist developer who mostly dabbles in web stuff and know enough JS/TS, Python, and Go to get around. 

Three of my proudest/favorite projects so far are:
- [Clone of Elicit's UI from 2023](https://github.com/bk7312/elicit-clone)
- [Collection of bookmarklets](https://github.com/bk7312/bookmarklets)
- [API for Kevin Kelly's unsolicited advice](https://github.com/bk7312/kk-advice)

When I'm not coding, I like to read books, drink tea, and do calisthenics (but not all three at the same time). ![](https://hit.yhype.me/github/profile?user_id=14029543)

Wanna chat? Feel free to schedule a call in [Calendly](https://calendly.com/bk7312/call).

Fun fact: I can do [mirror writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_writing) with my left hand!
