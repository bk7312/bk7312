### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer who specializes in Next.js and React. When I'm not coding, I usually like to read books and drink tea, do some calisthenics, or dabble in the art of ukulele-ing. ![](https://hit.yhype.me/github/profile?user_id=14029543)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my collection of [bookmarklet](https://bk7312.github.io/bookmarklets/). I adore bookmarklets, they're just so simple and versatile! If only I can use typescript... Maybe I'll try making browser extensions next.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mobile development with React Native. The first thing a lot of non-dev people ask when I tell them I'm a developer is: "So you make android/ios apps?". I took that as a sign.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source JS/TS projects, let me know if you need a helping hand and I'll see what I can do!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with connecting developers to people with tech-solvable problems. There's a lot of developers out there, how do we best connect them to people with tech-solvable problems?
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you find interesting or curious about, I have lots of opinions that I may or may not be entitled to have.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can schedule a call on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/bk7312/call) and let's chat!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can do [mirror writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_writing) with my left hand!
